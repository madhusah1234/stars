<h1 class="a1" > What is Version control System</h1>
<p class="a3">Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps record changes to files by keeping a track of modifications done to the code.<br>
<strong>Use of Version Control System:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>A repository:</strong> It can be thought as a database of changes. It contains all the edits and historical versions (snapshots) of the project.</li>
<li><strong>Copy of Work (sometimes called as checkout):</strong> It is the personal copy of all the files in a project. You can edit to this copy, without affecting the
work of others and you can finally commit your changes to a repository when you are done making your changes.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h1 class="a1">Why we use Version Control System</h1>
<p  class="a3">A version control system allows users to keep track of the changes in software development projects and enable them to collaborate on those projects.Using it,the developers
can work together on code and celebrate their tasks through branches.<br>There can be several branches in a version control system ,according to the number of collaborators .
The branches  maintain individuality as the code changes remain in a specified branch(s).<br>Developers can combine the code changes when required .Further ,they can view 
the history of changes,go back to the previos version(s)ans use /manage code in the desired fashion.</p>
<h1 class="a1">GIT Commands</h1>
  <p  class="a3"><strong class="a2">git init : </strong>This command turns a directory into an empty Git repositery.This is the first step in creating a repositery .After running git init,adding and 
    committing files/directories is possible.</p>
  <p  class="a3"><strong class="a2">git commit</strong>Record the changes made to the files to a local repositery.For easy reference ,each commit has a unique ID.Its best practice to include a message
    with each commit explaining the changes made in a commit.Adding a commit message helps to find a particular change or understanding the changes.</p>
  <p  class="a3"><strong class="a2">git fork :</strong>A fork is a copy of a repositery .Forking a repositery allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project</p>
